# NES-Emulator

A Nintendo Entertainment System game console emulator for learning about low level concepts.

Many of the most important concepts to understand for building this program can be found here... https://www.nesdev.org/wiki/Nesdev_Wiki

## Basic Concepts

### Hexadecimal
Similar as how in binary we use a combination of 2 digits to represent a number, and 10 for decimal, in hexadecimal we use 16. These 16 digits being 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, and F.

Let's look at an example:
- Decimal: 65
- Binary: 0b01000001
- Hexadecimal: 0x41, $41, #41, x41

Here we can also notice that when not showing a decimal representation that we have a prefix.

### Bitwise Operations

Their are 6 basic biwise operations we will be using in this project which are...

- `&` - AND
- `|` - OR
- `~` - NOT
- `^` - XOR
- `<<` - SHIFT LEFT
- `>>` - SHIFT RIGHT
